          ###MEET APP

Description

A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

Dependencies

React, Javascript, GH-Pages

+As a USER, I should be able to INTERACT WITH A CONTROL, in order to VIEW AND HIDE LOCAL EVENTS

+As a USER, I should be able to SET A LOCATION, in order to VIEW THE NUMBER OF EVENTS IN THAT LOCATION

+as a USER, I should be able to FULLY USE THE APP EVEN IF OFFLINE, in order to NOT BE DEPENDENT UPON AN INTERNET CONNECTION

+as a USER, I should be able to VIEW GRAPHICAL CHARTS AND GRAPHS DESCRIBING VARIOUS DATA REGARDING EVENTS, in order to BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION AT A GLANCE

+as a USER, I should be able to FIND AND START THE APP VIA A MENU ICON ON MY DEVICE OF CHOICE, in order to EASILY AND CONVENIENTLY RUN THE APP 

Serverless functions will be used to interact between the meet app and the separate services and apis needed in order to run the app properly. Such as googleOAuth, which will provide an access key to the protected api. The google calendar api itself, which will provide the necessary data needed to view and manage locations and events in the app.
